1. [Pong Game üèì](https://github.com/Varunvj5/ping-pong-game)

- Pong is a table tennis‚Äìthemed arcade sports video game, featuring simple two-dimensional graphics.
- And we all have played this classic arcade game atleast once in our childhood, haven't we? 
- So, I have tried to make this particular game using python.
- I have used Turtle library to create this game's graphics.

2. [Digital Clock üìü](https://github.com/Varunvj5/Digital_Clock)

- A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally (i.e. in numerals or other symbols), as opposed to an analogue clock. 
- Later in the future I will be modifying this clock to also function as an alarm.
- Python here comes as its backend program.
- Tkinter library has been used as GUI toolkit.

3. [Calculator üßÆ](https://github.com/Varunvj5/calculator)

- Since the advent of calculators our life has been simplified.
- So, here I present you with a basic calculator which you can use day in & day out to make your life less complex.
- As usual the parent language used is python.
- The GUI help has been provided by the tkinter library.
